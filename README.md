# 3s-Software

This is a mock project for an interview

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run the project**

   Open a terminal in the project root and run the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## NOTE: Since this is test, I kept the secrets in the `appSettings.json`. But for production build, this will not be the case
